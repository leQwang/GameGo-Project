Rational for the project:
- Video games have been part of my child hood, aside from ... 
- However, games are sometime quite expensive to purchase. I like using steamDB to check for the price, yet I found that it was not the best to offer.
- Steam allow user to enter a key to retrieve the product. Thus, there are many third-party company selling these keys at the retail price.


What have I learned and enhanced throughout the journey:

*Phase 1: Homepage Design and RawG Api 
- Endeavour implementation of the first Vite project
- Learn and practice UI-UX design concept (Layout, Color, Font, etc)
- Learn and apply framer-motion
- Use react observer to check when the div is inView
- Optimize fetching to reduce request call (Reduce call for rendering games list on first load from 3 to 1) - useRef to check for initial load (can be enhanced by using useState and checking if the value is undefined at the useEffect)
- Apply Lazy loading, skeleton, loader effect to enhance user experience and speed
